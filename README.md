This project aims to evaluate various machine learning models for predicting heart disease and provide a critical analysis 
of the field to identify gaps and recommend approaches to improve accuracy and patient outcomes. A large and unpopular medical 
dataset of “Personal key factors for Heart Disease” was selected for this study as it provides uncommon features and a high 
imbalance to the target feature. Three machine learning approaches were attempted: Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, and SVM, with 
three alternatives for each approach namely the basic model, regularised model, and cross-validated with hyperparameter tuned 
model. The proposed models were evaluated and compared to models proposed by other researchers.
